Project created by Gustavo Sanchez Sanchez Jr., student at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

This project was greatly influenced by a subject that was taught within INFO 3101: History of Information and Computing where we learned about the MINITEL.

The MINITEL was a small computer-like component that was regarded to be the first successful online service prior to the World Wide Web. It was greatly used in France where people were able to send messages to one another, reserve train tickets, look-up the phone directory, and so much.

This program is an attempt to simulate how a text-based terminal user program ran back in the old days. I currently have program set to only do three things: email, check stock prices, and look-up the phone directory.

The email function was originally going to allow users to send real emails based off their Gmail however, the idea was shot down due to some privacy issues concerning Google.

The checking stock function does give the actual price of whatever company that is listed within NASDAQ. Please follow the instructions within the program.

The look-up phone directory is just a simple page with fake names and phone numbers (for the sake of peoples' privacy).

Any comments are welcome and I hope you like my program!
