# Description

Project created by Gustavo Sanchez Sanchez Jr., a student at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

This project was greatly influenced by a subject that was taught within INFO 3101: History of Information and Computing where we learned about the MINITEL. The MINITEL was a small computer-like component that was regarded to be the first successful online service before the World Wide Web. It was greatly used in France where people were able to send messages to one another, reserve train tickets, look up the phone directory, and so much more. This program is an attempt to simulate how a text-based terminal user program ran back in the old days. I currently have the program set to only do three things: email, check stock prices, and look up the phone directory.

* The email function was originally going to allow users to send real emails based on their Gmail however, the idea was shot down due to some privacy issues concerning Google.

* The checking stock function does give the actual price of whatever company is listed within NASDAQ. Please follow the instructions within the program.

* The look-up phone directory is just a simple page with fake names and phone numbers (for the sake of peoples' privacy).

Any comments are welcome and I hope you like my program!

# Prequisites
You will have to make sure that you download and have these files within the same folder: `terminal_project.py` and `Buff.jpg`.
You must have **Python3** installed along with these Python libraries: **curses**, **pyfiglet**, **numpy**, **smtplib**, **time**, **datetime**, **threading**, and **requests**. There may be some additional libraries that I am not aware of but may be also required. Python will throw errors if it cannot find a libarary or if a library is not installed. **Install all libraries which Python may be complaining about until you get no errors. This process will most likely take place within the running process.**
*Note: Google is your friend!*

# Run
You will open up your terminal and redirect to the path of the exact folder that I mentioned before. For example, for Windows, I use `cd "C:\CU Boulder - Fourth Year\Second Semester\History of Information and Computing\Project"` to get to the folder in which my files are located in.
Next, you simply run the program by running the `python3 terminal_project.py` command within your terminal. **If you do not have the libraries installed, this is where those Python errors will appear!**

# Notes
* To delete text within this program, you will have to use the **delete** button rather than the **backspace** button. *Tested on Windows, may be different on Mac*.
* Please pay attention to the instructions within the program!
* No personal data/information is gathered.
* There may be some small bugs still present within the program. Report any, if you can.
* I may be missing some additional notes but I advise to get a feeling of the program by messing around with it. Have fun!
